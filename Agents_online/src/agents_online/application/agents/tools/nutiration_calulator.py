## Your Stats
- **Age**: {age} years
- **Weight**: {weight} kg ({round(weight * 2.205)} lbs)
- **Height**: {height} cm ({round(height / 2.54)} inches)
- **Gender**: {gender.title()}
- **Activity Level**: {activity_level.replace('_', ' ').title()}
- **Goal**: {goal.replace('_', ' ').title()}

## Calorie Calculations
- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: {round(bmr)} calories/day
- **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: {round(tdee)} calories/day
- **Target Daily Calories**: **{round(target_calories)}** calories/day

## Macronutrient Breakdown
### Protein ü•©
- **{macros['protein']['grams']}g** daily ({macros['protein']['percentage']}% of calories)
- {round(macros['protein']['grams']/4)} servings of 25g protein portions

### Carbohydrates üçû
- **{macros['carbs']['grams']}g** daily ({macros['carbs']['percentage']}% of calories)
- Focus on complex carbs: oats, rice, sweet potatoes, fruits

### Fats ü•ë
- **{macros['fat']['grams']}g** daily ({macros['fat']['percentage']}% of calories)
- Include healthy fats: nuts, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish

## Meal Timing Suggestions
- **Protein**: Spread evenly across {round(macros['protein']['grams']/30)} meals
- **Pre-workout**: 20-30g carbs, 10-15g protein (1-2 hours before)
- **Post-workout**: 30-40g carbs, 20-30g protein (within 2 hours)
- **Hydration**: Minimum {round(weight * 0.033)} liters of water daily

## Important Notes
- These are estimates based on formulas - individual needs vary
- Track progress and adjust calories by 100-200 if needed
- Weigh yourself weekly at the same time for consistency
- Focus on whole, minimally processed foods
- Consider a multivitamin and omega-3 supplement
